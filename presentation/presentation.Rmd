# Let's Dive In!

# https://github.com/iamaspacecoyote/2022_iowa_st_business_analytics

---
## Objectives of this discussion

- **Provide a starter pack on the R ecosystem to support report creation in HTML**

--

- Provide examples of packages to build reports and display analysis

--

- Sprinkle in tips and tricks to make your reports dazzling and reproducible


---

## Self-study extensions (i.e. not covered)

- Setting up version control 
    - Please use it! Check out Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and Github with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)

--

- Details of the tables or graphics packages 
    - These could easily be (and probably already are) their own long form tutorials.

---

## Can you relate to this process of reporting?

- Do analysis in one tool (Excel/R/Python/SAS/SPSS/Minitab/Stata/Matlab)

--

- Make tables and charts in another tool (Excel/Tableau/PowerBI)

--

- Screenshot or paste everything into a text editor (Word/LaTeX)

--

- Turn it into a final product (PDF/PowerPoint)

## We can do it all with R!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "95%", out.extra='style="float:center"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/environmental-data-science-r4ds-general.png")
```

---

## What is R?

 - R is an **open source software** suite including
    - an effective **data handling** and storage facility,
    - a suite of operators for **calculations** on arrays, in particular matrices,
    - an integrated collection of intermediate tools for **data analysis and graphics**, and
    - a **programming language** which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

--

## R works best when combined with RStudio

RStudio is an **open source** integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

## [*Action Item*] Download and Install R & RStudio

- Install R 4.1.3 or higher
    - Navigate to a geographical close CRAN mirror: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
        - Use the Iowa State mirror: https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/

 - Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code and contain groups of useful functions.
     - [CRAN is a great place to find packages.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html)
 - [You can make your own packages to support your work!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45Hs9XyN68)

# Making Dazzling Reports

---

![Artwork by @allison_horst](img/cracked_setwd.png)

---

## R Project 

"R experts keep all the files associated with a project together â€” input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures. This is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects." 

-- Hadley Wickham ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))

--

R projects define your working directories:

  - Paths are relative rather than fixed
  - Your work is portable and tidy

---

## [*Action Item*] Open/Make an R project

### [Create a Project (Video)](https://youtu.be/CojhAWZ92FE)
 1. Open RStudio 
 2. Configure global options to avoid saving .Rdata (1-time step)
     - Tools -> Global Options -> Workspace -> Uncheck the box. Change the dropdown to Never.
     - Restart RStudio
 3. Create an R project to associate with a set of files

### [Open the Project for this talk (Video)](https://youtu.be/h6w5cn4xaKE)
 1. Download files from Github
 2. Click on R project file
 
---

## Folder Infrastructure

.pull-left[ 

- Store code (R scripts) separate from your reporting (R Markdown) files
 
- Consider pre-processing and storage of summary data 
 
- Don't try to fit too much into one report; separate reports can sit in one folder
 ]

## What is R Markdown?

R code + Markdown (text-to-HTML conversion tool) = R Markdown

--

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

--
 - As an environment for you to do data science or analytics.
 
--

 - Collaborating with colleagues with interest in your conclusions and how you reached them (the code).

--
 - **For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.**

---

## [*Action Item*] R Markdown Walkthrough

 - Open the dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - YAML Header & knitting with parameters
        - [Style output using bslib themes](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/)     
        - [Style output using HTML themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
     - Code chunks and hiding code
     - Markdown & LaTeX
     - Using tabs and drop downs to improve pagination
     - Connection to file organization
     - Adding HTML
         - 'Easter eggs' for other analysts

## Why HTML

]

.pull-right[
- HTML is *interactive* without being Shiny
- HTML is *portable* and everyone you know has a web browser
- TeX overhead can be high for creation of pdf and RMD files may fail to knit in different environments 
]

---

## If you must PDF

 - As long as you are not using LaTeX outside of R, you can use a minimal install of TeX via the `tinytex` package
```r 
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
 - [TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)

 - YMMV: errors can accumulate especially if you don't have admin rights on your computer

## The Rest of the Owl

---

## Building tabular content

There are many table packages. For HTML, [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) or [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) are good starting points. For pdf, [`kableExtra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) is the gold standard.

.center[![](img/tidydata_7.jpg)]

---

## Building graphical content

[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) works great as a static graphics package. For interactive graphics, use packages like [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/) or [`highcharter`](https://jkunst.com/highcharter/).

.center[![](img/presenting_monster.png)]

---

## UX Principles 

 - Create tables and graphics to support a narrative
     + Storyboard your ideas on paper or a whiteboard before diving in
 - Build the tables and graphics outside of R Markdown first to avoid extra loading overhead
 - Think about your user's needs
     + Do they like to download the data?
     + Are you using color in an intentional way? ([1 in 12 men are colorblind](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness))
 - Your report should:
     + Have a clear hierarchy that makes navigation natural
     + Understand and embrace accessibility
     + Maintain time consistency - transition to or away from ideas slowly
 
---

## Extensions

 - Version control of your reports (Git or other options)
 - Deployment on a centralized server such as RStudio Connect opens up options such as scheduled reporting with email blasts
 - HTML reporting could be extended to [true Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) reporting if your users are asking for more interactivity

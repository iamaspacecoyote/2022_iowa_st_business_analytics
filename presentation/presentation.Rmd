# Let's Dive In!

# https://github.com/iamaspacecoyote/2022_iowa_st_business_analytics

---
## Objectives of this discussion

- Provide a starter pack on the R ecosystem and setup to support report creation in HTML

--

- Provide examples of table and graphics packages to display analysis

--

- Sprinkle in tips and tricks to make your reports dazzling and reproducible


---

## Self-study extensions (i.e. not covered)

- Setting up version control 
    - Please use it! Check out Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and Github with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)

--

- Details of the tables or graphics packages 
    - These could easily be their own long form tutorials

---

## Can you relate to this process of reporting?

- Do analysis in one tool (Excel/R/Python/SAS/SPSS/Minitab/Stata/Matlab)

--

- Make tables and charts in another tool (Excel/Tableau/PowerBI)

--

- Screenshot or paste everything into a text editor (Word/LaTeX)

--

- Turn it into a final product (PDF/PowerPoint)

## We can do it all with R!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width= "95%", out.extra='style="float:center"'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/environmental-data-science-r4ds-general.png")
```

---

## What is R?

 - R is an **open source software** suite including
    - an effective **data handling** and storage facility,
    - a suite of operators for **calculations** on arrays, in particular matrices,
    - an integrated collection of intermediate tools for **data analysis and graphics**, and
    - a **programming language** which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

--

## R works best when combined with RStudio

RStudio is an **open source** integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

---

## [*Action Item*] Download and Install R & RStudio

- Install R 4.1.3 or higher
    - Navigate to a nearby CRAN mirror: https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html
        - Use the Iowa State mirror: https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/
    - Choose the download for your operating system

- Install RStudio 2022.02.0+443 or higher
    - Navigate to https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
    - Choose the download for your operating system
---

## R packages

 - The open source nature of R allows users to create software extensions called *packages*.
 - Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code.
 - [You can make your own packages to support your work!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J45Hs9XyN68)

---

## [*Action Item*] Installing Packages

 - Open RStudio
 - Run the following command in your R console window
 
```{r library_install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c('dplyr', 'tidyr', 'rmarkdown', 
                   'ggplot2', 'fredr', 'highcharter', 'plotly'))
```

## R users are an amazingly supportive community

# Making Dazzling Reports

---

![Artwork by @allison_horst](img/cracked_setwd.png)

---

## R Project 

"R experts keep all the files associated with a project together â€” input data, R scripts, analytical results, figures. This is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects." 

-- Hadley Wickham ([R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html))

--

R projects define your working directories:

  - Paths are relative rather than fixed
  - Your work is portable and tidy

---

## Folder Infrastructure

.pull-left[ 

- Store code (R scripts) separate from your reporting (R Markdown) files
 
- Consider pre-processing and storage of summary data 
 
- Don't try to fit too much into one report; separate reports can sit in one folder
 ]
 
.pull-right[ 
 
 ![Folder structure](img/folder.jpg)

]

---

## [*Action Item*] Make an R project

 1. Open RStudio 
 2. Configure global options to avoid saving .Rdata
     - Tools -> Global Options -> Workspace -> Uncheck the box. Change the dropdown to Never.
     - Restart RStudio
 3. Create an R project to associate with this talk or another set of files

## What is R Markdown?

R code + Markdown (text-to-HTML conversion tool) = R Markdown

--

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

--
 - As an environment for you to do data science.
 
--

 - Collaborating with other data scientists with interest in your conclusions and how you reached them (the code).

--
 - **For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.**

---

## [*Action Item*] R Markdown Walkthrough

 - Open the dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - YAML Header & knitting with parameters
     - Code chunks
     - Markdown & LaTeX
     - File organization
     - Adding HTML and tables
---

## Dazzling Elements in R Markdown

 - Using parameters in YAML header
 - Hiding code chunks and including 'Easter eggs' for other analysts
 - Using tabs and drop downs to improve pagination
 - Adding meaningful color to output
 - [Style output using HTML themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)

---

## Why HTML

.pull-left[
![](https://media.giphy.com/media/qDxe3pb4myxggnPe9u/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e472wy9p3ozzzbrk4x3okwtsjygmurjaci8oorrmq7m&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)
]

--

.pull-right[
- HTML is *interactive* without being Shiny
- HTML is *portable* and everyone you know has a web browser
- TeX overhead can be high for creation of pdf and RMD files may fail to knit in different environments 
]

---

## If you must PDF

 - As long as you are not using LaTeX outside of R, you can use a minimal install of TeX via the `tinytex` package
```r 
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
 - [TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)

 - YMMV: errors can accumulate especially if you don't have admin rights on your computer

---

## Building tabular content

There are many table packages. For HTML, `DT` and `reactable` are good starting points. For pdf, `kableExtra` is the gold standard.

.center[![](img/tidydata_7.jpg)]

---

## Building graphical content

`ggplot2` works great as a static graphics package. For interactive graphics, use packages like `plotly` or `highcharter`.

.center[![](img/presenting_monster.png)]

---

## Tips for Tables and Graphics

 - Create tables and graphics to support a narrative
     + Storyboard your ideas on paper or a whiteboard before diving in
 - Build the tables and graphics outside of R Markdown first to avoid extra loading overhead
 - Think about your user's needs
     + Do they like to download the data?
     + Are you using color in an intentional way? (1 in 12 men are colorblind)

---

## Additional UX principles for reporting

Your report should:

 - Have a clear hierarchy that makes navigation natural
 - Understand and embrace accessibility
 - Maintain time consistency - transition to or away from ideas slowly
 
---

## Extensions

 - Version control of your reports
 - Deployment on a centralized server such as RStudio Connect opens up options such as scheduled reporting with email blasts
 - HTML reporting could be extended to true Shiny reporting if your users are asking for more interactivity

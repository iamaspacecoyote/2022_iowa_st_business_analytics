## Can you relate to this process of reporting?

- Do analysis in one tool (Excel/R/Python/SAS/SPSS/Minitab/Stata/Matlab)

--

- Make tables and charts in another tool (Excel/Tableau/PowerBI)

--

- Screenshot or paste everything into a text editor (Word/LaTeX)

--

- Turn it into a final product (PDF/PowerPoint)

## We can do it all with R!

## What is R?

 - R is an **open source software** suite including
    - an effective **data handling** and storage facility,
    - a suite of operators for **calculations** on arrays, in particular matrices,
    - an integrated collection of intermediate tools for **data analysis and graphics**, and
    - a **programming language** which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.

## R works best when combined with RStudio

RStudio is an **open source** integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It includes a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging and workspace management.

---

## R packages

 - The open source nature of R allows users to create software extensions called packages
 - Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code.

## In this tutorial

- How to set up your R ecosystem to support report creation in HTML (and PDF)

--

- Examples of table and graphics packages to support analysis

--

- Tips and tricks to make your reports dazzling and reproducible


---

## Not in this tutorial

>- Setting up version control - please use it! Check out Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and Github with R](https://happygitwithr.com/)
>- Details of the tables or graphics packages - these could easily be their own tutorials
>- Shiny - we are going to focus on HTML (primary) and PDF (secondary) reports

The good news is several speakers tomorrow will cover Shiny and other graphics applications!

## What is R Markdown?

R code + Markdown (text-to-HTML conversion tool) = R Markdown

--

R Markdown files are designed to be used in three ways:

--
 - As an environment for you to do data science.
 
--

 - Collaborating with other data scientists with interest in your conclusions and how you reached them (the code).

--
 - **For communicating to decision makers, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.**

---

## Let's do it!

 1. Open the 0_dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - YAML Header
     - Code chunks
     - Markdown/LaTeX
 2. Open the 1_dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - File organization
 3. Open the 2_dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - Knitting with parameters
 4. Open the 3_dazzle.Rmd file inside the report folder
     - Adding HTML and tables
---

## Dazzling Elements in R Markdown

 - Using parameters in YAML header
 - Hiding code chunks and including 'Easter eggs' for other analysts
 - Using tabs and drop downs to improve pagination
 - Adding meaningful color to output
 - [Style output using HTML themes](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/)
   
---

## Folder Infrastructure

.pull-left[ 

- Store long R scripts separate from your R Markdown files
 
- Consider preprocessing and storage of summary data 
 
- Don't try to fit too much into one report; separate reports into their own folder

## Why HTML

.pull-left[

- HTML is *interactive* without being Shiny
- HTML is *portable* and everyone you know has a web browser
- TeX overhead can be high for creation of pdf and RMD files may fail to knit in different environments 
]

---

## If you must PDF

 - As long as you are not using LaTeX outside of R, you can use a minimal install of TeX via the `tinytex` package
```r 
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
 - [TinyTeX is a custom LaTeX distribution based on TeX Live that is small in size](https://yihui.org/tinytex/)

 - YMMV: errors can accumulate especially if you don't have admin rights on your computer

---

## Building tabular content

There are many table packages. For HTML, `DT` and `reactable` are good starting points. For pdf, `kableExtra` is the gold standard.

---

## Building graphical content

`ggplot2` works great as a static graphics package. For interactive graphics, use packages like `plotly` or `highcharter`.

---

## Tips for Tables and Graphics

 - Create tables and graphics to support a narrative
     + Storyboard your ideas on paper or a whiteboard before diving in
 - Build the tables and graphics outside of R Markdown first to avoid extra loading overhead
 - Think about your user's needs
     + Do they like to download the data?
     + Are you using color in an intentional way? (1 in 12 men are colorblind)

---

## Additional UX principles for reporting

Your report should:

 - Have a clear hierarchy that makes navigation natural
 - Understand and embrace accessibility
 - Maintain time consistency - transition to or away from ideas slowly
 
---

## Extensions

 - Version control of your reports
 - Deployment on a centralized server such as RStudio Connect opens up options such as scheduled reporting with email blasts
 - HTML reporting could be extended to true Shiny reporting if your users are asking for more interactivity
